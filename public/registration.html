    <p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT AT CITIGROUP
        To help the United States Government fight terrorism and money laundering, Federal law requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person that opens an account. What this means for you: when you open an account, we will ask for your name, a street address, date of birth, and an identification number, such as a Social Security number, that Federal law requires us to obtain. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents that will allow us to identify you. We appreciate your cooperation.
        Terms, conditions and fees for accounts, products, programs and services are subject to change. Not all checking products may be available at time of account opening as early as July 2022. For updated information, please see the Citi Checking Accounts page.
